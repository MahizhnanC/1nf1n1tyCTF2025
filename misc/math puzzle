I wrote a Python script that:
Connects to the challenge using a socket.
Sends an initial newline (\n) to start the challenge.
Receives data from the server, parses each math question.
Uses Pythonâ€™s built-in eval() to compute the answer.
Sends the result back to the server immediately.

Script:
import socket
import re

host = 'chall.1nf1n1ty.team'
port = 5000

s = socket.socket()
s.connect((host, port))

# Start the challenge by simulating Enter key
s.send(b'\n')

def solve_expression(expr):
    try:
        return str(eval(expr))
    except:
        return ""

data = b""
while True:
    try:
        data += s.recv(4096)
        text = data.decode()
        print(text)

        match = re.search(r'Question \d+ ?: (.+?) =', text)
        if match:
            expr = match.group(1)
            answer = solve_expression(expr.strip())
            s.send((answer + '\n').encode())
            data = b""
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        break

s.close()



Upon successful completion of the 100 questions, the server responds with the flag:


Correct answer!!
Incredible! You've answered all 100 questions under 30 seconds!
You've proven your math dominance.
Here is your well-earned flag : 1nf1n1ty{y0u_4r3_4_m47h_m4573r}
