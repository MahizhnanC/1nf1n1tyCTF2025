To reverse the process and find the original flag from the cryptic_flag, we must invert the operations:

For each character c in cryptic_flag:
Find its ASCII code: ord(c).
Divide by 2 (undo the multiplication by 2).
Subtract 1 (undo the addition of 1).
Convert the result back to a character.
After processing all characters, reverse the whole string to undo the initial reversal.
Then reverse the string to get the flag.

def deobfuscator(cryptic_flag):
    temp = ""
    for c in cryptic_flag:
        val = (ord(c) >> 1) - 1
        temp += chr(val)
    flag = temp[::-1]
    return flag

cryptic_flag = "üæhlæhîhæÀhìæpÀjÀhæjÀìbôøôêdÞdÎÞd"
print(deobfuscator(cryptic_flag))


flag = 1nf1n1ty{0bfusc4t10n_r3v3rs3d}
