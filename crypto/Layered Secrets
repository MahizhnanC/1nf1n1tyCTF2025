The given ciphertext was generated by applying three transformations to the original flag:

XOR Encryption: The flag was XORed byte-by-byte with a repeating key. The key used here was unknown initially.
Mathematical Transformation: Each byte of the XORed output was then incremented by 17 modulo 256. This added a layer of obfuscation on top of the XOR.
Encoding: The transformed bytes were base64-encoded and then hex-encoded to produce the final ciphertext.

Decryption Steps:

Hex Decode: Convert the hex-encoded ciphertext back into base64-encoded bytes.
Base64 Decode: Decode the base64 bytes to retrieve the transformed data.
Inverse Mathematical Transform: Subtract 17 modulo 256 from each byte to reverse the earlier addition.
XOR Decryption: Using the key, XOR the result to recover the original plaintext.

Key Recovery:

The known prefix of the flag 1nf1n1ty{ was used to recover the key.
By XORing the decrypted prefix bytes with the known prefix, the key was found to be "tr1cky".

Using the key "tr1cky", the full flag was successfully decrypted as:

flag - 1nf1n1ty{x0r_plus_17_tr1ck3y_math_cipher}
