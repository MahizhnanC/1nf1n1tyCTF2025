used ghidra and found this in the functions:

Reverse Engineering Writeup: Full Flag Extraction

Part 1 (print_1st_part)
Prints the fixed string:
1nf1n1ty{

Part 2 (print_2nd_part):

Contains encoded string bytes: 0x5e326c2f62303276 and 0x5e2f36
Each character is printed after adding 1 to its ASCII value.
Decoding gives:
w31c0m3_

Part 3 (print_3rd_part):

Contains string: "A553mb1y}" stored reversed, and prints it in reverse order
So it outputs:
}y1bm355A
Reverse it back to get the final part of the flag:
A553mb1y}


Final Flag:
1nf1n1ty{w31c0m3_A553mb1y}
