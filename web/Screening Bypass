I used ModHeader extension

Screening 1:
Set User-Agent to CTFPlayer

Screening 2:
Set Referer to trusted.com

Screening 3:
Set Accept to application/xml

Screening 4:
Set Accept-Language to ja-JP

Screening 5:
Set Host to localhost

Screening 6:
Set Cache-Control to no-cache

Reloaded the page after setting all headers to get the flag:

1nf1n1ty{h34d3r_m4n1pul4710n_4_7h3_w1n}
