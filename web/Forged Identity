Opened the site, checked cookies using DevTools.
Found a cookie containing a JWT.
Decoded the JWT using https://token.dev.

Header:
{ "alg": "none", "typ": "JWT" }
Payload:
{ "user": "user" }
The JWT uses alg: none, which means no signature is required — a critical vulnerability.

Exploit:
Modified the payload from "user": "user" → "user": "admin"
Left the signature blank (as alg: none requires no verification)
Generated the new token.
Replaced the cookie value in the browser.
Refreshed the page — gained admin access
