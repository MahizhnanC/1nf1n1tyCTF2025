Vulnerability:

The int type on most systems is a 32-bit signed integer, with a maximum value of 2,147,483,647 (or 0x7FFFFFFF).
If we input 2147483647 as the cost:
cost > 0 is true
cost = cost + 100 becomes 2147483647 + 100
This overflows the 32-bit signed integer limit and wraps around to a negative number: -2147483549
cost < 0 becomes true, and print_flag() is executed

Input:

Enter the cost: 2147483647
cost after adding 100: -2147483549
