### Vulnerability Analysis:

- The program uses `gets()` to read input â€” this is unsafe and allows buffer overflow.
- The buffer `buf` is 64 bytes.
- The integer `is_admin` is stored immediately after `buf` on the stack.
- By sending more than 64 bytes, you can overwrite `is_admin`.
- Overwriting `is_admin` with a non-zero value (e.g., `1`) will grant admin access and print the flag.

### Exploit Strategy:

- Send 64 bytes to fill the buffer.
- Send 4 bytes to overwrite `is_admin` with the value `1` (little-endian: `\x01\x00\x00\x00`).
- Send a newline character `\n` to submit the input.

### Exploit Command:

```bash
(printf 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA'; printf '\x01\x00\x00\x00\n') | nc chall.1nf1n1ty.team 5004
