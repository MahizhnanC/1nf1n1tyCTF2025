Opened the APK in jadx-gui directly to browse the decompiled Java source.

Found an activity named FlagActivity which sets its content view to activity_flag.xml.

Checked the layout XML in jadx and found the flag text inside a hidden TextView with white text on a white background.


flag - 1nf1n1ty{such_basic_android_stuff}
