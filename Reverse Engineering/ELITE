First, I identified elite_linux as a PyInstaller executable. I used pyinstxtractor.py to unpack it, which gave me elite.pyc (the compiled Python bytecode file).

However, traditional decompilers like decompyle3, uncompyle6, and even pycdc all failed to convert elite.
pyc back into readable Python code. They simply don't support Python 3.12's new bytecode format yet.


Since decompilation was a no-go, I switched to bytecode disassembly. 
This method shows the low-level instructions the Python virtual machine runs, allowing me to manually piece together the program's logic.

I used Python's built-in dis module within a Python 3.12 virtual environment.
A custom script helped me load elite.pyc and print its disassembly to elite_disassembly.txt.


The disassembly revealed a clear pattern:

The program prompts the user for input: "Give the secret Phrase to join the elite: ".
It then performs a series of checks. Each check takes a character from the user_input at a specific index and compares it to a specific character.
If all these checks pass, the program prints "you are in the elite now!!!". If any check fails, it prints "Invalid\nHint: The flag is hidden somewhere in this python code".
By systematically going through each comparison in the disassembly, I extracted the character at its corresponding index.


Putting all the pieces together from the bytecode comparisons, I reconstructed the secret phrase:

flag - 1nfln1ty{phy7h0n_15_fun}
