the corrupted PNG image file named image.png that appeared broken because its bytes were reversed. This caused important PNG structures, 
like the IEND chunk that should be at the end, to appear scrambled at the start (e.g., DNEI instead of IEND).

so i wrote a simple python sccript :

input_file = 'image.png'
output_file = 'fixed_image.png'

with open(input_file, 'rb') as f:
    data = f.read()

# Reverse the entire byte sequence
fixed_data = data[::-1]

with open(output_file, 'wb') as f:
    f.write(fixed_data)

print(f"Reversed the file bytes and saved to {output_file}")

flag - 1nf1n1ty{0h_7h4t_w4s_r3v3rs3d!!}
